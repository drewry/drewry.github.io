> I am a technologist, futurist and creative thinker. I found my love for technology at a very young age where I enjoyed experimenting with DOS. Not long after the arrival of those first AOL disks in the mail, I was writing my first applications on the web. Soon after, I figured out that I could earn money with these skills. So I started selling websites to businesses around my hometown of Auburn, Alabama.
>
> By the time I was in college (graduated from Auburn University in 2010 Magna Cum Laude) I had my own business. I was working in several computer technologies including JavaScript, SQL, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, CSS, and HTML. This allowed me to broaden my skillset and find my true passion -- rapid prototyping. I loved going from idea to execution in as fast a method as possible -- using technologies that allowed me to move at the speed of thought. By the time I graduated, I knew that I wanted to move to Atlanta to expand my career.
>
> Over the past decade I've developed my career working for companies both large and small, developing applications and leading developments teams from start to finish. I strive to work on projects that allow me to innovate and focus on my ability to lead and inspire a team. I've worked on projects for Coca Cola, Turner Broadcasting, Chik-fil-a, AT&T, Darden Restaurants, Aflac, McDonald's and many others.

> You can find me speaking in Atlanta at our [Google Developer Group](http://www.meetup.com/gdg-atlanta/){:target="_blank"}, where I'm a co-organizer, or at just about any tech event in town. If you have a need of someone with my skillset, feel free to drop me a note at my email.
